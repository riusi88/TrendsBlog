                Spike Lee's latest film, <em>Oldboy</em>, is a remake of the 2003 Korean film of the same name directed by Chan-wook Park. In general, film remakes have to fight an uphill battle because they are always being compared to their predecessors. In addition to being well directed, well acted, well written, etc., a remake needs to prove that it’s not redundant. What makes remaking <em>Oldboy</em>, specifically, so challenging is that one of the aspects of the film that makes it so great is watching the mystery unfold, and so filmgoers who have already seen the original will already know the story’s dramatic conclusion. Lee's <em>Oldboy</em> is a great film, but since it’s not as good as the original, and since you can only experience <em>Oldboy</em>’s twisted mystery being unveiled once, you are better off watching Park’s version.

                This concludes the spoiler-free portion of this film review. The following will be analysis of what makes Park’s <em>Oldboy</em> better than Lee's. But first, what better beer to drink with this movie than Tree Brewing Company’s <em>Cutthroat Pale Ale</em>? This beer has a strong, sharp taste that will make you think of REVENGE! And also, throat-cutting is what Spike Lee’s <em>Oldboy</em> is all about!

                    <p>Contrary to popular belief, Lorem Ipsum is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Richard McClintock, a Latin professor at Hampden-Sydney College in Virginia, looked up one of the more obscure Latin words, consectetur, from a Lorem Ipsum passage, and going through the cites of the word in classical literature, discovered the undoubtable source. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance. The first line of Lorem Ipsum, "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet..", comes from a line in section 1.10.32.</p>

                    <p>If we’re going to be serious about our blog here at Movies and Beer, we’re going to have to do our homework. That’s why I’ve taken it upon myself to dig deep into film history and attempt to give you all a brief introduction about the early days of cinema, and some of the major films that shaped the future of filmography.  The Great Train Robbery, Battleship Potemkin, and Cabinet of Dr. Caligari will all be covered, and of course I haven’t forgotten about drinking some of my favourite beers, Steam Whistle, Muskoka’s Mad Tom IPA, and Erdinger Weissbier along the way. </p>

                    <p><strong><em>Following</em></strong> is a 1998 neo-noir drama set in London that traces the lives of two mysterious strangers:  a young writer and a thief. If you like the kind of movies that hinge on dialogue and character dynamics as the driving force, then definitely check this one out. Not only is it reason enough to see this movie for its gripping and nuanced plot, but it also happens to be Christopher Nolan’s first feature film (the same director who created Inception and The Dark Knight).</p>
