					<h2>Gran Torino</h2>

					<h3><em>Pabst Blue Ribbon</em></h3>
				</header>

				<p>Clint Eastwood’s Gran Torino is kind of like a coming of age movie. Except the film’s protagonist Walt Kowalski is already pretty old. Walt is a widowed Korean War veteran and former Ford employee living in a Detroit neighbourhood predominantly populated by Hmong refugees escaping violence in Vietnam. The film explores Walt’s relationship with the surrounding community as he begins to communicate and interact with them.</p>

				<p>This relationship begins when Walt’s neighbour, Thao, is pressured into stealing his Gran Torino as initiation into his cousin’s gang. Walt catches Thao and stops him by threatening him with a really big gun. After this incident Walt begins to develop a relationship with the boy and his family.</p>

				<p>In Gran Torino, Eastwood uses imagery as a metaphorical device to establish the many themes apparent throughout the film as well as the background of his character. The most apparent image in the film is his prized 1972 Ford Gran Torino Sport which Walt helped to build himself.</p>

				<p>But I’m not going to talk about the car. Another prominent image in the film is Pabst Blue Ribbon, an American style lager originally brewed in Milwaukee, Wisconsin. Throughout the film, Kowalski can be seen drinking Pabst Blue Ribbon. I think one of the most interesting things about Pabst is its two very different cultural associations.</p>

				<p>The film uses Pabst, along with many other symbols, to establish the character’s American working class background. Before its decline and subsequent resurgence, Pabst was commonly perceived to be a working class beer; it was (and still is) cheap and isn’t terrible. In the early 2000’s Pabst Blue RIbbon experienced a revival due to it’s popularity among urban hipsters. So now Pabst is commonly associated with hipster culture. Why did they start drinking Pabst? No idea.</p>
				
<p>The beer itself is nothing special. It tastes like your typical run-of-the-mill American style Lager. I probably wouldn’t casually drink a single Pabst by itself. However, if you are in a situation that calls for multiple beers and you have a small budget, Pabst is a great choice. This is because it has a discount price, but tastes a bit better than other beers in the same price range.</p>
				
<p>However, on the other hand Gran Torino is a pretty great movie. Eastwood does an excellent job showing character growth while simultaneously maintaining the essence of his character’s working class background. Moreover, the film effectively illustrates the issues surrounding immigration, white-flight, cultural assimilation, and gang violence. Gran Torino explores the aspects of humanity that transcend race, culture, and language. I’ve seen the film more than once, which is saying a lot because I usually never watch movies more than twice; I highly recommend it.</p>	

				<p>In regards to Pabst, I wouldn’t recommend it for casual drinking because it isn’t amazing. However, if you’re getting a pitcher with some friends or going to a house party and are strapped for cash, it’s a great option. This is because it’s one of the cheapest beers available (at least in Ontario), and it isn’t too bad.</p>
