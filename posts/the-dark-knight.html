				<p>As I sat and watched this dark, depressing continuation of Batman’s journey, I couldn’t help but feel giddy inside. Frankly, this isn’t my first time watching The Dark Knight, but I still remember most of the emotions I had in theatres opening day in July 2008. Waterloo Dark is as its name implies, is a dark lager, which suits perfectly with the tone and setting of the movie. Although a dark beer, Waterloo Dark has a surprisingly light taste, fitting for the mindset of someone like myself, who has grown up watching Batman movies and cartoon TV-series. I enjoyed the first of the trilogy, but this one honestly blew me away – just as you think the battle is coming to end, you’re met with explosions and more explosions. I sincerely appreciate Christopher Nolan for portraying Batman as everything I thought he should of been: depressed, desperate, and a serious bad-ass. What made me choose to review the second of the three films, however, was the internal battle for me to cheer for the antagonist. Heath Ledger’s rendition of the Joker – a wildly unpredictable harbinger of disaster – was so well played that I felt deep down inside that someone needed to cheer for him. I’ve watched this movie many times over, but there’s so much story that I notice a little more every time.</p>

				<p>Just as Bruce thinks he sees a sliver of light, the second plot arrives to shut that door with a bang – that sound coming from the corpse of a wannabe Batman falling against the glass window the Mayor. By the time Bruce Wayne realizes the actual problem lies in the Joker, Commissioners were being poisoned and judges were being blown to smithereens. Christopher Nolan continuously attempts to give us context to the Joker’s madness with the always-wise Alfred and his story of a bandit during his time in Burma – “…some men aren’t looking for anything logical, like money. They can’t be bought, bullied, reasoned or negotiated with. Some men just want to watch the world burn.”</p>

				<p>Heath Ledger makes this Joker a truly frightening clown with his long, dirty hair and dripping face paint. His grotesque red lipstick scar and the series of stories which gave him them, were simply brilliant; it gave us a little context of the circumstances of the his past, even though they could have been totally false and made-up. Two scenes particularly stood out to me: first, his skipping outside of Gotham General Hospital in a nurse dress as it burned and blew to the ground and hanging out the window of a cop car, wind-blowing in his hair as he laid his head back in total euphoria.</p>
				
				<p>Meanwhile, Christian Bales’ Bruce Wayne is finally met with someone he cannot intimidate and at the same time knows how to hit every spot that hurts. He begins to lose faith in himself – seemingly giving up to reveal his identity, only to be averted by Harvey Dent – and the justice he’s been trying to uphold as the Joker threatens his beloved city and has him helplessly riding around town in attempt to save the love of his life. He is nearly provoked into stooping down to his enemy’s level as he accelerates towards a taunting Joker after a jaw-dropping car-exploding, truck-flipping scene in downtown Gotham. All hope had seemingly been lost after the explosion that simultaneously destroys his hopes of the future, a life with Rachel and relinquishing his duties to Harvey Dent.</p>
